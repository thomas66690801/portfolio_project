**Description**
>I have decided to keep mine simple and minimal, using css grid and a few touches of ;

>1. change of colors link upon hovering.
>2. embeded souncloud link for autoplay music. A pro subscription will allow me to a more clean and minimalist design of the widget.
>3. formspree, a free form contact to email service. Originally was tinkering on the idea of a livechat button with smallchat integrating to Slack, but this will either connecting the current workspace or create a new workspace.(Smallchat remains an attractive tool, as it allows you to talk to the user instantly through Slack)
